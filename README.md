BoxLaunch
=========

Handles synchronizing the contents of two folders and running an executable. Used for in-house deployments of applications.

BoxLaunch uses multiple threads for copying files from source to target.
The number of threads to be used will be automatically determined based on your processor.

By default, BoxLaunch will compare files between the two directories based on Last Write Date as reported by windows.
However, if the source directory contains a .blhash file (generated by running the hash command), the .blhash file will 
be examined and used to determine which files need to be updated. 

You can add a .blignore file to the source directory to tell boxlaunch to ignore files or folders. This functions similarly
to the .gitignore file in a Git repository.
